In this lab, I will install osTicket which is an open source software used for help desk ticketing. This will completed using a VM created in Azure. The necessary installation files that are used are located <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6">here!</a><br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure virtual machine
- osTicket v1.15.8
- Installing Active Directory in one of the virtual instances
- Heidi SQL
- MySQL
- PHP Manager
- VC Redist

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
First, I  to created a resource group in Azure in which our VM will be installed into. Once the VM is running, I can make all the necessary installations to get osTicket installed. I'm using a VM build with Windows 10 and it is using a quad cores with 16GB of RAM which should be sufficient for this lab to supply with enough computing power.

Next, I connect to this newly created VM using the Remote Desktop Connection which is a default Windows program. For the sake of this tutorial, I am masking the public IPv4 address of the Azure VM. The public IPv4 address, username and password defined while creating the VM are all required for access.
